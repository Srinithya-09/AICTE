Resume Ranking
Abstract
The Resume Ranking project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to automate the evaluation and ranking of resumes based on job descriptions. This system extracts key information such as skills, experience, and education from resumes, compares them against job requirements, and assigns a relevance score.
